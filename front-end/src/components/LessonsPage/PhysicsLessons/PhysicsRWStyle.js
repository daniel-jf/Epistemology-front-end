            <p>Biophysics, also known as biological physics, is an interdisciplinary science that applies the principles of physics and chemistry and the methods of mathematical analysis and computer modeling to understand how the mechanisms of biological systems work.</p>
            
            <p>Biophysics is a molecular science that seeks to explain biological function in terms of the molecular structures and properties of specific molecules. The size of these molecules varies dramatically, from small fatty acids and sugars (1 nanometer (nm), or the equivalent of three atoms in width), to macromolecules such as proteins (5 to 10 nm), to starches (greater than 1,000 nm and longer than the thickness of a human hair), to the enormously elongated DNA molecules (more than 1 centimeter long but only 20 nm wide, or the scaled equivalent of a piece of string 45 miles long). These biomolecules, the sole building blocks of living organisms, assemble into cells, tissues and whole organisms by forming complex individual structures that are visible under a light microscope.</p>
